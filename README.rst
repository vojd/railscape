Railscape
=========

Helping migrating data from Rails to Django
-------------------------------------------
... one little schema file at the time.

Usage
-----
    * Clone the project
    * python railscape.py -f name_of_schema.rb
    * A models.py file should now be created in the same directory as railscape.py

Note
----
I wrote this to help me out in a specific situation. I haven't tried this against other schema files and the code could need some modifications to work with your file(s).
Feel free to fork it and have a go at your particular use case.
